# UCLE
## _Ultimate Computer Learning Environment_

Ever wanted to design **your own processor architecture**? Or to **play around** with an **existing one**? Ever wondered how the computer **really thinks** and **does** it's **job**? Or wanted to make him **do some other job**? Did you perhaps wish one day to make **your own operating system**? Or a **programming language**? Perhaps you once tried to understand how does the **compiler actually work**, but couldn't because it was too complex?

*Look no further!* - **UCLE is meant to answer just that.**

## Idea
The idea of **UCLE** is precisely this - to allow you, whoever you might be (a student, a programmer, a computer engineer, a professor, or just someone interested in computers), to **understand** and **experience first-hand** the depths of **how it all works together** inside of a computer - the **processor**, **IO devices** and other **hardware components**; the **operating system** with all it's features and modules; **programming languages**, **algorithms** and **data structures**; the **compiler**, **assembler**, **linker** and **loader**; **communication protocols**, **disk filesystems**, **multimedia algorithms**, and many, many more. It is meant to **show** you all these things **in action**, but also to allow you to **experiment** with them, to change and extend some or all of the components, or even design whole new systems in a way you see as the most appropriate for your purposes.

## Building the project

UCLE project uses [SCons](http://scons.org/) build tool for building all it's C++-based components. SCons requires a Python runtime, and can be installed via Python-pip, using the following command:
```
pip install scons --wheel
```
(wheel flag is currently neccessary because installation without it encounters some errors).

Once SCons is installed, this repository should be cloned with
```
git clone https://github.com/zjurelinac/UCLE.git
```
(or it can be downloaded it as zip and then extracted).

Once you have the repository, go to `ucle` folder and run `scons`, and wait for the project to build.

## Using UCLE CLI tools

UCLE project offers you several CLI tools for various use-cases.

### FNSIM

**Fnsim**, a functional processor simulator, is one of them. It can be used for debugging and/or assembly code correctness testing, for any of the supported processor architectures (so far only FRISC). It can be started with
```
./build/core/debug/fnsim-cli PROC_ARCH PFILE_PATH [-ijrx] [check CHECKS...]
```
and it supports various modes of simulation execution.

#### Basic mode

#### Interactive mode
TODO

#### JSON-controlled mode

#### Execution-tracking mode
TODO

#### Checker mode

#### Generic option flags

### ASM

### LNK
